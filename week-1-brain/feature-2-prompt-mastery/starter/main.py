Feature 2: Prompt Mastery — starter

Feature 1's /api/chat endpoint is complete and working — run this file and
you'll have a working chat server immediately. Your job is to implement
/api/chat/structured, which requires two things:
  1. A well-crafted system prompt that tells the model exactly what JSON to return.
  2. JSON parsing code that turns the model's text response into a StructuredResponse.

Steps:
  - Step 1: Write _STRUCTURED_SYSTEM_PROMPT (below)
  - Step 2: Parse the LLM result into a StructuredResponse in chat_structured()

Run with:
    uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

# TODO (Feature 2, Step 1): Write the system prompt.
#
# This prompt is the most important thing you write in this feature.
# It must instruct the model to return ONLY a JSON object (no markdown, no
# extra text) with exactly these four fields matching StructuredResponse:
#
#   "intent":         one of "general_question", "domain_question",
#                     "action_request", or "unclear"
#   "answer":         your plain-English reply to the user's message
#   "confidence":     a float between 0.0 and 1.0
#   "sources_needed": true or false
#
# Tips for a strong prompt:
#   - Define each intent value precisely so the model classifies consistently.
#   - Give confidence guidelines (e.g., what 0.9 vs 0.4 means).
#   - Say "respond ONLY with the JSON object" — say it twice if needed.
#   - Replace [YOUR_DOMAIN] with your actual domain.
#   - Shorter, more direct prompts usually outperform long rambling ones.
#
# See resource/prompt-engineering-workbook.md for worked examples and exercises.

  - "unclear": ambiguous, nonsensical or doesn't fit any other categories.

Confidence Score Guidelines:
 - 0.9-1.0: You are certain with clear common knowledge/domain facts.
 - 0.6-0.8: You are quite sure but the user must verify.
 - 0.3-0.5: You are uncertain. The answer may be partially correct or incomplete.
 - 0.0-0.2: You dont know and mostly guessing.
